🛡 Cybersecurity Basics

CIA Triad

Confidentiality – Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized users.

Integrity – Protecting information from unauthorized modifications.

Availability – Ensuring resources are accessible when needed.

Common Threat Types

Phishing – Fake emails/websites tricking users into giving credentials.

Malware – Viruses, worms, trojans causing harm or stealing data.

DDoS – Overwhelming a service to make it unavailable.

SQL Injection – Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases.

Brute Force – Trying many password combinations until success.

Ransomware – Encrypts files and demands ransom.

Attack Vectors

Social Engineering – Manipulating humans into giving away sensitive info.

Wireless Attacks – Exploiting Wi-Fi protocols (e.g., WPA cracking).

Insider Threats – Malicious or careless actions by employees.

🐧 Linux Fundamentals

File System Navigation

cd (change directory), ls (list files), pwd (print current directory).

File & Directory Permissions

chmod – change file permissions.

chown – change file ownership.

Package Management

apt install <pkg> – install packages.

dpkg -i <file.deb> – install .deb files.

Networking Commands

ifconfig – view network interfaces.

ping <IP> – test connectivity.

netstat – view active connections/ports.

traceroute <host> – trace path to a host.

🌐 Networking Basics

OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Session → Presentation → Application.

Each layer serves the one above it.

TCP/IP Protocol Suite

Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access layers.

Core protocols: TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP.

DNS

Translates domain names into IP addresses.

Example: nslookup google.com.

HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP – Unsecured communication.

HTTPS – Encrypted using SSL/TLS.

IP Addressing

IPv4 (32-bit), IPv6 (128-bit).

Subnetting – Divides networks into smaller segments.

NAT (Network Address Translation) – Maps private IPs to public IPs.

🔐 Cryptography Basics

Symmetric Encryption

Same key used for encryption & decryption.

Example: AES, DES.

Asymmetric Encryption

Uses public key for encryption & private key for decryption.

Example: RSA, ECC.

Hashing

Converts input into a fixed-size string.

Examples: MD5 (128-bit), SHA-256 (256-bit).

One-way, used for password storage & integrity checks.

Digital Certificates & SSL/TLS

Certificates prove authenticity of websites.

TLS ensures secure communication (confidentiality + integrity).

Hands-On (OpenSSL)

Encrypt message: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.enc.

Decrypt message: openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.enc -out file.txt.
